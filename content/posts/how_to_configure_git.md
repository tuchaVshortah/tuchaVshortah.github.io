# About Git and Remote Code Repositories

Git was designed to enable versioning of the source code. You can use it to store and modify your code reliably in a local or a remote repository. It allows you to collaborate with others and revert changes if you need to do so. The main advantage of using Git it shows how the source code changed and the descriptions and comments left by developers.

Remote code repositories such as Github and GitLab allow you to conveniently share your code with others. Depending on your needs you might want to verify your identity you create new commits. Both Github and GitLab allow you to do so by utilizing signed commits. We will focus on Github in this article.
