**Responsibilities:**

I worked as a cybersecurity engineer at Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK), where I applied my skills in Python and Rust to test the bank's network security and develop software that would detect ARP spoofing attacks in local network. In three months, I contributed to enhancing the bank's cybersecurity posture and preventing potential breaches. I also learned new techniques and tools from my colleagues and mentors, who were experienced and supportive professionals in this domain.

**What did I do?**

I participated in a competition organized by Epam, which included a few interviews and a few weeks-long course covering the fundamentals of Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps. All participants were required to complete the course by a certain deadline, or they would be disqualified.

I successfully completed the course and moved on to the next one, the DevOps Bootcamp. This bootcamp was a logical continuation of the previous course, and it covered a wide range of topics, including Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub/GitLab CI, Kubernetes, AWS, and Terraform.

The Bootcamp was both challenging and incredibly interesting. I learned many new skills and worked with tools and software that I was unfamiliar with before. By the end of the bootcamp, we also had a few sessions on Gen AI, Agile, and SDLC.. To summarize, by the end of the course, I had learned how to create Docker images, create Kubernetes clusters with persistent storage and various features such as DaemonSets and StatefulSets. I also learned how to use AWS resources like EC2, ECS, EKS, SNS, SQS, SSM, and KMS. I was able to write and deploy CloudFormation stacks and create resources in the cloud using Terraform. In addition, I learned many other things during the Bootcamp.

I would like to thank the folks at Epam for organizing this amazing Bootcamp.
