[{"content":"About Git and Remote Code Repositories Git was designed to enable versioning of the source code. You can use it to store and modify your code reliably in a local or a remote repository. It allows you to collaborate with others and revert changes if you need to do so. The main advantage of using Git it shows how the source code changed and the descriptions and comments left by developers.\nRemote code repositories such as Github and GitLab allow you to conveniently share your code with others. Depending on your needs you might want to verify your identity you create new commits. Both Github and GitLab allow you to do so by utilizing signed commits. We will focus on Github in this article.\nAbout Verified/Signed commits By default, whenever you push a commit to a remote Github repository it does not know a true identity attached to the commit. This might, potentially, make it harder for other users and your collaborators verify your identity.\nOther changes applied through the Github\u0026rsquo;s web interface and pull requests are verified using a verified signature managed by Github.\nDepending on your needs you might want to use your own signature to verify your commits and other changes such as merge requests.\nThis can be configured by notifying Github about the identity or a GPG key attached to your commits.\nLearn more\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how_to_configure_git/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"about-git-and-remote-code-repositories\"\u003eAbout Git and Remote Code Repositories\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit was designed to enable versioning of the source code.

My mission is to develop convenient and powerful software on durable and industry leading platforms.\nEducational background Astana IT University (2021-2024) Bachelor of Cybersecurity Department of Informational Security Suleyman Demirel University (2024 - Today) Master of Computer Science Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Work experience 2021 (3 months) Development Bank of Kazakhstan - Cybersecurity Engineer\nResponsibilities:\nI worked as a cybersecurity engineer at Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK), where I applied my skills in Python and Rust to test the bank\u0026rsquo;s network security and develop software that would detect ARP spoofing attacks in local network. In three months, I contributed to enhancing the bank\u0026rsquo;s cybersecurity posture and preventing potential breaches. I also learned new techniques and tools from my colleagues and mentors, who were experienced and supportive professionals in this domain.\nProjects:\narp-spoofing-detector-rs\n2024 (6 months) Akhmet Yassawi University - IT Specialist\nResponsibilities:\nMy responsibilties included managing employee accounts and sites. I uploaded the necessary information to the sites and updated them. I helped the staff to fill out, set up and regain access to their work accounts if they lost it.\n2024 (5 months) Epam Systems - Student Cloud\u0026amp;DevOps Trainee (Apprenticeship)\nWhat did I do?\nI participated in a competition organized by Epam, which included a few interviews and a few weeks-long course covering the fundamentals of Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps. All participants were required to complete the course by a certain deadline, or they would be disqualified.\nI successfully completed the course and moved on to the next one, the DevOps Bootcamp. This bootcamp was a logical continuation of the previous course, and it covered a wide range of topics, including Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub/GitLab CI, Kubernetes, AWS, and Terraform.\nThe Bootcamp was both challenging and incredibly interesting. I learned many new skills and worked with tools and software that I was unfamiliar with before. By the end of the bootcamp, we also had a few sessions on Gen AI, Agile, and SDLC.. To summarize, by the end of the course, I had learned how to create Docker images, create Kubernetes clusters with persistent storage and various features such as DaemonSets and StatefulSets. I also learned how to use AWS resources like EC2, ECS, EKS, SNS, SQS, SSM, and KMS. I was able to write and deploy CloudFormation stacks and create resources in the cloud using Terraform. In addition, I learned many other things during the Bootcamp.\nI would like to thank the folks at Epam for organizing this amazing Bootcamp.\nPersonal achievements Almaty Marathon 2024 My goals I would like to expand my knowledge in the area of cloud technologies and DevOps, as well as contribute to the development of various cloud-based or on-premises services.\nMy final Goal is to become a well experienced and certified Cloud\u0026amp;Devops Developer with a strong competency in full stack WEB development.\nCertificates Google Cybersecurity Professional -\u0026gt; PDF\nMalware Analysis and Introduction to Assembly Language -\u0026gt; PDF\nCareer Essentials in Cybersecurity by Microsoft and LinkedIn -\u0026gt; PDF\nAWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials -\u0026gt; PDF\nIELTS Band 7.5 -\u0026gt; JPG\nAgile Foundations\nSoftware Design: From Requirements to Release\nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/whoami/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Nurkanat and I am 20 years old.
